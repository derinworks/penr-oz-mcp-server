# penr-oz MCP Server

[![Tests](https://github.com/derinworks/penr-oz-mcp-server/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/derinworks/penr-oz-mcp-server/actions/workflows/tests.yml)

A FastMCP-based server for the penr-oz project with secure sandboxed filesystem operations. This repository provides tools for reading files and listing directories within a protected sandbox environment.

## Install

Create and activate a virtual environment first:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

```bash
pip install -e .
```

For development and testing:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Run

```bash
python server.py             # stdio server
fastmcp run server.py        # if using the FastMCP CLI
```

## Features

### Core Reasoning Prompts

The server provides a curated collection of reusable MCP prompts demonstrating best practices for common reasoning and analysis tasks.

#### Available Prompts

**`summarize_text(text: str)`**
- Generate concise summaries of documents and articles
- Extracts key points and main ideas from text content
- Useful for: Documentation review, article analysis, content condensation

**`extract_tasks(text: str)`**
- Identify actionable tasks and TODOs from text
- Parses meeting notes, documentation, and messages for work items
- Formats tasks with deadlines and assignees when mentioned
- Useful for: Meeting notes processing, project planning, task tracking

**`analyze_code(code: str, language: str = "python")`**
- Comprehensive code quality and structure analysis
- Identifies potential bugs, code smells, and security vulnerabilities
- Provides performance considerations and improvement suggestions
- Useful for: Code reviews, technical debt assessment, learning best practices

**`write_design_doc(feature_description: str, context: str = "")`**
- Creates detailed technical design documents
- Covers architecture, implementation approach, and trade-offs
- Includes sections for security, testing, and risk analysis
- Useful for: Feature planning, system design, architectural decisions

**`refactor_instructions(code: str, issues: str, language: str = "python")`**
- Generates step-by-step refactoring guidance
- Explains rationale for each improvement
- Provides refactored code with risk considerations
- Useful for: Technical debt resolution, code modernization, pattern improvements

#### Backward Compatibility

**`summarize_prompt(text: str)`** - *Deprecated*
- Legacy alias for `summarize_text()`
- Maintained for backward compatibility with existing MCP clients
- Use `summarize_text()` for new integrations

### API Integration Tools

The server provides tools for integrating with external HTTP APIs, demonstrating asynchronous operations with comprehensive error handling.

#### Tools

**`fetch_json(url: str, timeout: float = 10.0)`**
- Fetches JSON data from public HTTP APIs
- Supports asynchronous operations with configurable timeout
- Validates URLs and handles errors gracefully
- Example: `fetch_json("https://api.github.com/repos/python/cpython")`

**Error Handling:**
- `InvalidURLError`: Malformed URLs or unsupported schemes
- `TimeoutError`: Request exceeds timeout duration (default: 10s)
- `HTTPError`: Server returns error status (4xx, 5xx)
- `JSONDecodeError`: Response is not valid JSON
- `APIError`: Other network or request errors

**Usage Examples:**
```python
# Fetch repository information
await fetch_json("https://api.github.com/repos/python/cpython")

# With custom timeout
await fetch_json("https://api.example.com/data", timeout=5.0)
```

**Out of Scope:**
- Authentication and secrets management
- Webhooks or streaming
- Non-JSON responses

### Sandboxed Filesystem Access

The server provides secure, read-only access to files within a configured sandbox directory (`./sandbox/`). All file paths are validated to prevent directory traversal attacks.

#### Tools

**`list_files(path: str = "")`**
- Lists files and directories within the sandbox
- Returns metadata including name, type, path, and size
- Example: `list_files("docs")` to list the docs subdirectory

**`read_text_file(path: str)`**
- Reads UTF-8 text content from files within the sandbox
- Raises errors for non-existent files, directories, or invalid paths
- Example: `read_text_file("welcome.txt")`

#### Resources

**`ozfs://{path}`**
- Read-only file access via the ozfs:// protocol
- Example: `ozfs://docs/guide.md` returns the file contents

#### Security

- All paths are restricted to the `./sandbox/` directory
- Directory traversal attempts (e.g., `../`) are blocked
- Paths are validated and resolved before access
- Only UTF-8 text files can be read

## Modules

- `app/api.py` - API integration tools for external HTTP services (fetch_json)
- `app/config.py` - Server metadata, environment flags, and sandbox configuration
- `app/filesystem.py` - Secure filesystem operations with path validation
- `app/tools.py` - MCP tools (ping, list_files, read_text_file)
- `app/resources.py` - MCP resources (info, ozfs://)
- `app/prompts.py` - MCP prompt templates

## Adding tools, resources, and prompts

Define a new tool/resource/prompt in the relevant module, then register it in `server.py`.

Example registration:

```python
from app.tools import ping
mcp.add_tool(ping)
```

## Testing

Run the test suite locally:

```bash
pytest
```

### Continuous Integration

This project uses GitHub Actions to automatically run tests on every push and pull request. The CI workflow tests the codebase against Python 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12 to ensure compatibility across versions.

Tests must pass before pull requests can be merged. You can view the test results in the [Actions tab](https://github.com/derinworks/penr-oz-mcp-server/actions) or by clicking the badge at the top of this README.
